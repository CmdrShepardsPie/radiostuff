  "Coverage": "Located on South Almagre Mountain at 12,367 feet, it provides excellent coverage of nearly all of El Paso County and points east, along with coverage extending south past Pueblo. Locations very close in to the Front Range, or in the shadow of Cheyenne Mountain are not covered well. Since this peak is shorter than Pikes Peak its coverage to the north is not as good as Pikes Peak, although there are points northeast of Colorado Springs where there is coverage.",
